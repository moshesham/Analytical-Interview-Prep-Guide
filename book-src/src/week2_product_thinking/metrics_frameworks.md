# Metrics Frameworks: HEART and AARRR

## Introduction
Understanding metrics frameworks is crucial for product analysis and decision-making. This document covers two popular frameworks: HEART and AARRR, providing insights on how to apply them effectively.

## HEART Framework
The HEART framework is designed to help teams measure user experience and product success. It consists of five key components:

1. **Happiness**: Measures user satisfaction and emotional response.
   - Example Metrics: Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT).

2. **Engagement**: Assesses how users interact with the product.
   - Example Metrics: Daily Active Users (DAU), session length, frequency of use.

3. **Adoption**: Tracks the number of new users and their initial experiences.
   - Example Metrics: New user sign-ups, feature adoption rates.

4. **Retention**: Measures the ability to keep users over time.
   - Example Metrics: Churn rate, user retention rate.

5. **Task Success**: Evaluates how effectively users can achieve their goals.
   - Example Metrics: Success rate, error rate, time on task.

### Applying HEART
To apply the HEART framework:
- Identify the key user experience goals for your product.
- Select relevant metrics for each component.
- Regularly collect and analyze data to inform product decisions.

## AARRR Framework
The AARRR framework, also known as the Pirate Metrics, focuses on the customer lifecycle and is particularly useful for startups. It includes five stages:

1. **Acquisition**: How users find your product.
   - Example Metrics: Website traffic, conversion rates from marketing campaigns.

2. **Activation**: The first experience users have with your product.
   - Example Metrics: Percentage of users completing a key action (e.g., onboarding).

3. **Retention**: The ability to keep users coming back.
   - Example Metrics: Monthly Active Users (MAU), user engagement over time.

4. **Referral**: Encouraging users to refer others.
   - Example Metrics: Referral rates, NPS.

5. **Revenue**: The financial aspect of the product.
   - Example Metrics: Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), customer lifetime value (CLV).

### Applying AARRR
To implement the AARRR framework:
- Map out the customer journey and identify key metrics at each stage.
- Use data to optimize each stage, focusing on improving conversion and retention rates.

## Conclusion
Both HEART and AARRR frameworks provide valuable structures for analyzing product performance and user experience. By applying these frameworks, teams can make informed decisions that enhance product development and user satisfaction.

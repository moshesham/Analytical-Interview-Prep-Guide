# Product Case Study Practice

This document provides a structured approach to practicing product case studies. It includes exercises designed to help you think critically about product decisions, analyze user needs, and propose data-driven solutions.

## Practice Exercise 1: User Engagement Drop

### Scenario
User engagement on a popular social media platform has dropped by 5% over the last month. 

### Task
1. **Identify Key Metrics**: List the key metrics you would analyze to understand the drop in engagement.
2. **Hypothesis Formation**: Formulate three hypotheses that could explain the decline in user engagement.
3. **Data Analysis Plan**: Outline a plan for how you would analyze the data to test your hypotheses. Include:
   - Data sources you would use
   - Analytical methods (e.g., A/B testing, cohort analysis)
   - Success metrics to evaluate the impact of any changes made

## Practice Exercise 2: New Feature Proposal

### Scenario
You are tasked with proposing a new feature for an existing product to enhance user engagement.

### Task
1. **Feature Identification**: Choose a product you frequently use and identify a potential new feature that could improve user engagement.
2. **User Problem**: Describe the user problem this feature aims to solve.
3. **Target Audience**: Define the target audience for this feature.
4. **Success Metrics**: Identify the North Star metric for this feature and any additional metrics you would track to measure its success.
5. **A/B Testing Plan**: Outline a plan for how you would test the feature before full rollout, including:
   - Hypothesis
   - Success and guardrail metrics
   - Sample size estimation

## Practice Exercise 3: Competitive Analysis

### Scenario
A competitor has launched a new feature that has gained significant traction among users.

### Task
1. **Feature Comparison**: Analyze the competitor's feature and compare it with your product's existing features.
2. **SWOT Analysis**: Conduct a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) for your product in light of this new competitor feature.
3. **Strategic Recommendations**: Based on your analysis, provide strategic recommendations on how your product should respond to this competitive threat.

## Reflection

After completing each exercise, reflect on the following:
- What insights did you gain about product thinking and analysis?
- How did your understanding of user needs evolve through this practice?
- What areas do you feel you need to improve upon for future case studies?

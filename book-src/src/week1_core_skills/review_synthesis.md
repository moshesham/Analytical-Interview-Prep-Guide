# Review and Synthesis of Week 1 Core Skills

## Overview

This document synthesizes the core skills from Week 1 of the interview preparation plan, now updated to reflect a stronger focus on real-world product analytics, interview-ready theory, and hands-on application. The curriculum now includes:
- Deep-dive SQL (fundamentals, intermediate, advanced window functions)
- Applied statistics for product analytics (with new expert-level content)
- Python for data analysis, including advanced visualization and time series analysis

## Key Concepts


### SQL Fundamentals & Beyond
- **Basic Queries**: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY for foundational data retrieval.
- **Data Types**: INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, and their impact on analytics.
- **Aggregate Functions**: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() for summarizing data.
- **Intermediate SQL**: Mastery of JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and subqueries for complex business questions.
- **Advanced SQL**: Window functions (RANK, LAG, ROW_NUMBER) for cohort analysis, retention, and product metrics. See the expanded files in `src/week1_core_skills/sql/`.


### Applied Statistics for Product Analytics
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing user and product metrics (mean, median, variance) and interpreting their business impact.
- **Probability Distributions**: Modeling user behavior and rare events (Binomial, Poisson, Normal) in product settings.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: A/B testing, p-values, confidence intervals, and power analysis for product experiments.
- **Regression Analysis**: Quantifying relationships (e.g., feature impact on engagement, churn prediction).
- **Expert-Level Content**: See `advanced_statistics_expert.md` and `Theory-Product-Analytics-Action.md` for interview-ready theory and real-world analytics use cases.


### Python for Data Analysis & Product Insights
- **Data Cleaning**: Loading, cleaning, and exploring datasets using Pandas.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing data to uncover actionable insights.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Communicating findings with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly (see `advanced_visualization.md`).
- **Time Series Analysis**: Forecasting and trend analysis for product metrics (see `time_series_analysis.md`).


## Takeaways
- Mastery of SQL (including advanced window functions) is crucial for product analytics and interview success.
- Applied statistics, with a focus on product use cases, enables you to make data-driven decisions and communicate impact.
- Python proficiency, especially in cleaning, visualization, and time series, is essential for real-world analytics.


## Next Steps
- Review the updated SQL, statistics, and Python resources in the project, including:
  - `src/week1_core_skills/sql/advanced_window_functions.md`
  - `src/week1_core_skills/statistics/advanced_statistics_expert.md`
  - `src/week1_core_skills/statistics/Theory-Product-Analytics-Action.md`
  - `src/week1_core_skills/python/advanced_visualization.md`
  - `src/week1_core_skills/python/time_series_analysis.md`
- Practice SQL queries, statistical analysis, and Python projects with a product analytics mindset.
- Prepare for the upcoming weeks by focusing on product thinking, experimentation, and communicating business impact.

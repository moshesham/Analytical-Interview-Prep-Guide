# Review and Synthesis of Week 1 Core Skills

## Overview
This document serves as a review and synthesis of the core skills learned during Week 1 of the interview preparation plan. The focus areas include SQL fundamentals, intermediate and advanced SQL techniques, applied statistics, and Python for data analysis.

## Key Concepts

### SQL Fundamentals
- **Basic Queries**: Understanding SELECT statements, filtering with WHERE, and sorting results with ORDER BY.
- **Data Types**: Familiarity with common SQL data types such as INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.
- **Simple Functions**: Usage of aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().

### Intermediate SQL
- **JOIN Operations**: Mastery of INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.
- **GROUP BY Clause**: Grouping data to perform aggregate calculations on subsets of data.
- **HAVING Statement**: Filtering groups based on aggregate conditions.

### Advanced SQL: Window Functions
- **RANK()**: Assigning a rank to each row within a partition of a result set.
- **LAG()**: Accessing data from a previous row in the result set without the need for a self-join.
- **ROW_NUMBER()**: Assigning a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition.

### Applied Statistics
- **Probability Distributions**: Understanding Binomial and Poisson distributions and their applications in product analysis.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Grasping the concepts of p-values, confidence intervals, and statistical power to make data-driven decisions.

### Python for Data Analysis
- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques for loading, cleaning, and exploring datasets using Pandas.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, trends, and insights from data through visualization and statistical summaries.

## Takeaways
- Mastery of SQL is crucial for data manipulation and analysis.
- Understanding statistical concepts enhances the ability to interpret data and make informed decisions.
- Proficiency in Python, particularly with libraries like Pandas, is essential for data cleaning and analysis tasks.

## Next Steps
- Review the SQL and statistics resources provided in the project.
- Practice SQL queries and statistical analysis through hands-on projects.
- Prepare for the upcoming weeks by focusing on product thinking and experimentation skills.

# The Ultimate 21-Day Analytical Interview Prep Plan

This intensive 21-day plan is structured to build your skills from the ground up, moving from core technical abilities to strategic product thinking and, finally, to interview execution. Each day includes a primary focus, a specific "Do This" action, and targeted resources.

## Week 1: Core Skills - SQL and Statistics Mastery

**Goal:** Build a rock-solid, practical foundation in the two most critical technical areas.

| Day | Topic Focus | Do This | Handbook Reference | Targeted Resources |
|-----|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | SQL Fundamentals | Complete SQLBolt's interactive tutorials from start to finish. Focus on understanding JOIN logic. | SQL & Data Manipulation | SQLBolt |
| 2 | Intermediate SQL | Solve 5 medium-difficulty problems on DataLemur involving GROUP BY, HAVING, and subqueries. | SQL & Data Manipulation | DataLemur Questions |
| 3 | Advanced SQL: Window Functions | Read Mode's guide on Window Functions. Then, solve 3 problems on StrataScratch that specifically require RANK(), LAG(), or ROW_NUMBER(). | SQL & Data Manipulation | Mode's Window Functions Guide, StrataScratch |
| 4 | Applied Statistics: Probability & Distributions | Watch the StatQuest videos on Probability, Binomial, and Poisson distributions. For each, write down one product-related example. | Statistics & Probability | StatQuest: Probability, Binomial, Poisson |
| 5 | Applied Statistics: Hypothesis Testing | Read the "Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments" book summary. Explain p-values, confidence intervals, and statistical power out loud. | Statistics & Probability | Summary of "Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments" |
| 6 | Python for Data Analysis | Complete a full data cleaning and exploration project using Pandas to load, clean, and analyze a dataset. | Programming (Python/R) | Kaggle: "Data Cleaning Challenge" |
| 7 | Week 1 Review & Synthesis | Write a SQL query using a window function. Then, use Python to calculate the statistical significance of a hypothetical A/B test result. | SQL & Stats Sections | Use your own project or a Kaggle dataset |

## Week 2: Product Thinking & Experimentation

**Goal:** Shift from how to analyze data to what to analyze and why. This week is about product sense, metrics, and A/B testing.

| Day | Topic Focus | Do This | Handbook Reference | Targeted Resources |
|-----|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 8 | Developing Product Sense | Pick a feature on Facebook or Instagram. Deconstruct it: What user problem does it solve? Who is the target user? How does it help the business? | Analytical Reasoning/Product Sense | Lenny's Newsletter: "How to Develop Product Sense" |
| 9 | Metrics Frameworks (HEART/AARRR) | Read about the HEART and AARRR frameworks. Apply one of them to the feature you analyzed on Day 8. | Analytical Reasoning/Product Sense | Google's HEART Framework, AARRR Framework |
| 10 | Case Study Framework | Learn a structured approach for case studies. Outline a response to: "User engagement on Instagram Reels has dropped by 5%. How would you investigate?" | Analytical Execution/Case Study | Exponent's Guide to Data Science Case Studies |
| 11 | A/B Testing Deep Dive: Design | Read Airbnb's blog post on experimentation. Design an A/B test: form a hypothesis, choose success/guardrail metrics, and estimate sample size. | Designing Experiments | Airbnb: "Experimentation & Measurement" |
| 12 | A/B Testing Deep Dive: Analysis | Read Netflix's blog on interpreting A/B test results. Analyze a hypothetical result: What if your primary metric improves but a guardrail metric declines? | Quantitative Analysis | Netflix: "Interpreting A/B test results" |
| 13 | Product Case Study Practice | Complete one full case study walk-through. Record yourself speaking or write out a detailed document. | Analytical Execution/Case Study | StrataScratch's Product Sense Questions |
| 14 | Week 2 Review & Synthesis | Propose a new feature for a product you use daily. Define its North Star metric, design an A/B test, and explain how you would analyze the results. | Product Sense & Experimentation Sections | Apply concepts from this week |

## Week 3: Execution, Storytelling & Mock Interviews

**Goal:** Synthesize all your skills and practice delivering your analysis under pressure.

| Day | Topic Focus | Do This | Handbook Reference | Targeted Resources |
|-----|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 15 | Behavioral Interview: STAR Method | Prepare 3 stories using the STAR method: 1) A complex project, 2) Dealing with ambiguity, 3) Influencing a decision with data. | Behavioral Interview Prep | The STAR Method Guide |
| 16 | Data Storytelling | Watch a talk on data storytelling. Create a 3-slide presentation for your project from Day 6: 1) Problem, 2) Analysis & Insight, 3) Recommendation. | Communication (in Analytical Execution) | Brent Dykes: "Winning The Insights War" |
| 17 | Timed SQL + Python Challenge | Give yourself 45 minutes. Complete one hard SQL question and one medium Python/Pandas question back-to-back. | Technical Skills Interview | Use LeetCode or HackerRank |
| 18 | Full Mock Interview 1 (Technical) | Conduct a mock technical interview with a peer or on a platform. Focus on thinking out loud and explaining your code. | Technical Skills Interview | Pramp (free peer-to-peer mocks) |
| 19 | Full Mock Interview 2 (Product/Case) | Conduct a mock product sense or case study interview. Focus on asking clarifying questions and presenting a structured conclusion. | Analytical Execution/Case Study | Pramp, or record yourself |
| 20 | Review, Refine & Rest | Review your notes from the mock interviews. Identify your single biggest area for improvement and do one focused exercise on it. Then, rest. | Your own notes | |
| 21 | Final Polish & Mindset | Review Meta's core values. Re-read your 3 STAR stories and align them with those values. Do a light 30-minute review of key concepts. | Behavioral Interview Prep | Meta's Core Values |

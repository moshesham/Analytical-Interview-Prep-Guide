# Timed SQL and Python Challenge

## Overview
This document outlines a timed challenge designed to test your SQL and Python skills under pressure. The goal is to simulate a real interview environment where you need to think critically and solve problems efficiently.

## Challenge Structure
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Tasks:** 
  - Complete one hard SQL question.
  - Complete one medium Python/Pandas question.

## SQL Challenge
### Question
Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers who have made the highest total purchases in the last year. Include the customer's name and the total amount spent.

### Requirements
- Use appropriate JOINs if necessary.
- Ensure the query is optimized for performance.

### Expected Output
| Customer Name | Total Amount Spent |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Customer A    | $10,000             |
| Customer B    | $9,500              |
| Customer C    | $8,750              |
| Customer D    | $8,000              |
| Customer E    | $7,500              |

## Python Challenge
### Question
Given a dataset containing sales data, write a Python function using Pandas to calculate the monthly sales totals and return a DataFrame with the results.

### Requirements
- The dataset should have at least the following columns: `date`, `amount`.
- Ensure the function handles missing values appropriately.

### Expected Output
| Month      | Total Sales |
|------------|-------------|
| 2023-01    | $50,000     |
| 2023-02    | $45,000     |
| 2023-03    | $55,000     |

## Instructions
1. Set a timer for 45 minutes.
2. Begin with the SQL question and document your thought process.
3. After completing the SQL question, move on to the Python question.
4. Once finished, review your solutions for any potential optimizations or improvements.

## Reflection
After completing the challenge, take some time to reflect on:
- What strategies worked well for you?
- Where did you struggle, and how can you improve in those areas?
- Consider discussing your solutions with a peer or mentor for additional feedback.

## 1. Descriptive Statistics: The Foundation (and Product Metrics)


Descriptive statistics are the backbone of all data analysis. In product analytics, they help you summarize user behavior, engagement, and performance metrics at a glance.

- **Mean (μ):** The arithmetic average. Sensitive to outliers—always check for extreme values before interpreting the mean.
- **Median:** The middle value when the data is ordered. Robust to outliers and skewed data. In real-world data, the median often gives a better sense of “typical” than the mean.
- **Mode:** The most frequent value. Useful for categorical data or detecting multi-modal distributions.
- **Variance (σ²):** The average squared deviation from the mean. Variance is in squared units, which can make interpretation less intuitive, but it’s essential for understanding variability and is the basis for many statistical tests.
- **Standard Deviation (σ):** The square root of the variance, bringing the measure back to the original units. It quantifies the “typical” distance from the mean. In a normal distribution, about 68% of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean.


**Product Analytics Example:**
- Use the mean and median of session durations to spot changes in user engagement after a product update. If the mean jumps but the median doesn’t, you may have a few power users skewing the results.

**Expert Tips:**
- Always visualize your data (histograms, boxplots) before relying on summary statistics.
- Compare mean and median to assess skewness. Large differences often signal outliers or non-normality.
- For small samples, use the sample variance (divide by n-1) for an unbiased estimate.
- Always interpret these statistics in the context of the data’s source and business meaning.

## 2. Probability Distributions: Modeling Uncertainty (and User Behavior)


Probability distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random process. In product analytics, they help you model user actions, conversion rates, and rare events.

### Key Theorems for Product Analytics
- **Law of Large Numbers (LLN):** As the number of trials increases, the sample mean converges to the true population mean. This is why large sample sizes yield more reliable estimates. In A/B testing, the LLN justifies waiting for enough data before drawing conclusions.
- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** Regardless of the original data’s distribution, the distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as the sample size grows (assuming independent, identically distributed samples). This underpins the use of t-tests and z-tests in practice—even for non-normal data—when the sample is large enough. The CLT is the “great equalizer” of statistics.

### Key Distributions in Product Analytics
- **Normal Distribution:** Symmetric, bell-shaped, defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). The empirical rule (68-95-99.7) is a quick way to check for normality and spot outliers.
- **Binomial Distribution:** Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials. Used for conversion rates, A/B tests, and retention analysis.
- **Poisson Distribution:** Models the number of events in a fixed interval, given a known average rate. Used for web traffic, support tickets, etc.


**Product Analytics Example:**
- Use the binomial distribution to estimate the probability of a user converting after seeing an ad 10 times.
- Use the Poisson distribution to model the number of support tickets per hour.
- Use the normal distribution (via the CLT) to compare average session times between A/B test groups.

**Expert Tips:**
- Always check for skewness before applying parametric tests. Use transformations or non-parametric methods for highly skewed data.
- The CLT allows you to use normal-based inference for means, even if the raw data is not normal, as long as the sample is large enough.

## 3. Hypothesis Testing: Making Decisions with Data (A/B Testing & Experiments)


Hypothesis testing is the formal process of using data to evaluate competing claims (hypotheses) about a population. In product analytics, it’s the engine behind A/B testing, feature launches, and measuring impact.

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The default claim (e.g., no difference between groups).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The claim you want to test (e.g., a difference exists).
- **p-value:** The probability, under H0, of obtaining a result as extreme or more extreme than what was observed. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests the data is unlikely under H0, but it is not the probability that H0 is true. Always consider effect size and context.
- **Confidence Interval:** A range of plausible values for the population parameter. A 95% confidence interval means that, in repeated sampling, 95% of such intervals would contain the true value. Narrow intervals indicate precise estimates; wide intervals signal uncertainty or small sample size.
- **Statistical Power:** The probability of detecting a true effect (i.e., rejecting H0 when it is false). Power increases with larger sample size, larger effect size, and higher significance level. Low power means a high risk of missing real effects (Type II error).


**Product Analytics Example:**
- Use hypothesis testing to determine if a new onboarding flow increases user retention. H0: No difference; H1: Retention is higher with the new flow. Report the p-value, effect size, and confidence interval to stakeholders.

**Expert Tips:**
- Don’t over-interpret p-values. Always report effect sizes and confidence intervals.
- Understand the difference between statistical and practical significance.
- Use power analysis to plan experiments and avoid underpowered studies.

## 4. Regression Analysis: Quantifying Relationships (and Product Impact)


Regression analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying relationships between variables and making predictions. In product analytics, it helps you understand what drives user engagement, revenue, or churn.

- **Linear Regression:** Models the relationship between a continuous outcome and one or more predictors. The slope tells you the expected change in the outcome for a one-unit change in the predictor, holding others constant. Always check residuals for non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.
- **Logistic Regression:** Used for binary outcomes (e.g., click/no click). Models the log-odds of the outcome as a linear function of predictors. Coefficients are interpreted as odds ratios. Always check for multicollinearity and separation issues.


**Product Analytics Example:**
- Use linear regression to estimate how much an increase in daily notifications drives up DAU, controlling for seasonality.
- Use logistic regression to predict the probability a user will churn based on their activity patterns.

**Expert Tips:**
- Always validate your model with out-of-sample data and check assumptions before interpreting results.
- Use regularization (Lasso, Ridge) to prevent overfitting in high-dimensional data.
- Visualize residuals to diagnose model fit and spot violations of assumptions.

## 5. Final Thoughts: Interview Success


Statistics is not just about formulas—it’s about understanding uncertainty, making informed decisions, and communicating results clearly. In interviews, always connect your statistical reasoning to product impact and business value. Practice interpreting results in context, and always ask: “What does this mean for the user, the product, and the business?”
